    <h1>Game Design Project</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my game design portfolio. Feel free to explore my game projects.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h2>Beautiful Dream</h2>
        <div class="images">
            <img src="path-to-your-image-1.jpg" alt="Beautiful Dream screenshot 1">
            <img src="path-to-your-image-2.jpg" alt="Beautiful Dream screenshot 2">
        </div>
        <a class="download-link" href="path-to-download-file.zip">Download Game</a>
        <h3>Creative Vision</h3>
        <p>This is an extremely personal narrative work, full of details and fragments from my memory. Maybe in the eyes of others, it seems a little hazy, even inexplicable, but this is exactly the meaning of its existence - to evoke those emotions that are indescribable and inexplicable, but truly exist. As I always insist: walk your own path and decide your own life.</p>
        <h3>Game Description</h3>
        <p>You open your eyes and find yourself back in 2015 - the familiar classroom, young classmates, and young self, everything seems to have never changed. Did you travel from the reality ten years later, or is this just a dream about the future?</p>
        <p>In this short and gentle time travel, you will make your own choice between memories and reality.</p>

        <h2>Escape, Escape the Room</h2>
        <div class="images">

        <h3>Creative Vision</h3>
        <p>As a fan of suspense films, escape rooms have always been my favorite theme. This is also a more personal narrative. Whether it is the kitten, teacup, or notes, they all contain my ingenuity. There are many things I want to expand, but the content is limited, so it may seem simple.</p>
        <h3>Game Description</h3>
        <p>You find yourself trapped in a room with strange facilities and tables and chairs everywhere. Other creatures in this room guide you out, but the mysterious notes and 100-year-old trees hint at the intersection of time and space. So, did you find the way? Did you get out?</p>
